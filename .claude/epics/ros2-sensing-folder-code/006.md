# Task: Camera Compatibility Bridge Implementation

## Description
Implement topic compatibility bridges for camera data to enable safe migration to autoware namespaces while preserving perception system functionality. Based on ROS2 topic bridge patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create topic bridges: `/road_camera/image_raw` → `/sensing/camera/road_camera/image_raw`
- [ ] Create topic bridges: `/front_left_camera/image_raw` → `/sensing/camera/front_left_camera/image_raw`
- [ ] Implement bidirectional message bridging with <2ms latency
- [ ] Add configuration for enabling/disabling bridges during migration
- [ ] Preserve QoS profiles and message timing characteristics

## Technical Details
Following ROS2 topic bridge patterns:
```python
class CameraCompatibilityBridge(rclpy.Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('camera_bridge')
        
        # Subscribe to current topics
        self.road_sub = self.create_subscription(
            Image, '/road_camera/image_raw', self.road_callback, 10)
        
        # Publish to autoware topics
        self.road_pub = self.create_publisher(
            Image, '/sensing/camera/road_camera/image_raw', 10)
            
    def road_callback(self, msg):
        # Bridge with minimal latency
        self.road_pub.publish(msg)
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Understanding of current camera topics used by perception
- [ ] ROS2 topic bridging capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true (independent of sensor migrations)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Compatibility bridges implemented for all camera topics
- [ ] Bridge latency validated at <2ms for real-time performance
- [ ] Configuration system allows gradual migration control
- [ ] QoS profile preservation verified
- [ ] Bridges tested with perception system (no regression)
