# Task: Unified Sensing Launch System

## Description
Create unified sensing system launch architecture that brings together I2C sensors, independent sensors, microROS UART communication, and cameras into a cohesive autoware-aligned system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create master sensing launch file for complete system startup
- [ ] Implement modular sensor group selection (I2C, independent, cameras, microROS)
- [ ] Add proper startup timing (I2C sensors can start in parallel)
- [ ] Include compatibility bridges for camera migration support
- [ ] Provide configuration options for development vs production modes

## Technical Details
Launch system architecture:
```
sensing_system.launch.py
├── i2c_sensors.launch.py          # IMU, compass, light, humidity (parallel)
├── independent_sensors.launch.py  # GPS, RTK, CAN (parallel)
├── microros_bridge.launch.py      # UART4 TriCore communication
├── camera_system.launch.py        # Cameras with compatibility bridges
└── diagnostics.launch.py          # System health monitoring
```

**Configuration Parameters**:
- Sensor group enable/disable flags
- Hardware device paths and addresses
- Publishing rates and QoS settings
- Bridge enable/disable for migration control

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Environmental sensors migration completed
- [ ] Task 005: Independent sensors alignment completed
- [ ] Task 007: Camera migration completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: false (integration task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete sensing system launches successfully with single command
- [ ] Modular sensor selection working (can enable/disable groups)
- [ ] All sensors publishing to autoware-aligned topics
- [ ] System startup timing optimized and stable
- [ ] Configuration management working for different deployment modes
