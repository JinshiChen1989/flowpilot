# Task: Independent Sensors Autoware Alignment

## Description
Align GPS, RTK, and CAN sensors with autoware naming conventions and standard message types. These sensors have no shared resource constraints and can be updated independently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update GPS sensor to publish `/sensing/gps/fix` with sensor_msgs/NavSatFix
- [ ] Update RTK corrector to publish `/sensing/rtk/corrections` 
- [ ] Update CAN interface to publish `/sensing/can/vehicle_status`
- [ ] Standardize package structure following autoware patterns
- [ ] Update launch files for consistent parameter management

## Technical Details
Refactor existing packages:
- `src/sensing/gps/` → autoware-aligned GPS publishing
- `src/sensing/rtk/` → autoware-aligned RTK corrections
- `src/sensing/can/` → autoware-aligned vehicle data

**GPS Pattern**:
```python
# Update topic from /gps/fix to /sensing/gps/fix
self.gps_pub = self.create_publisher(NavSatFix, '/sensing/gps/fix', 10)
```

**Package Structure Standardization**:
- Consistent config/, launch/, test/ folder organization
- Standard package.xml and setup.py patterns
- Unified parameter naming conventions

## Dependencies
- [ ] No hardware dependencies (independent sensors)
- [ ] Understanding of autoware topic conventions

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true (no conflicts with I2C sensors)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] GPS, RTK, CAN sensors publishing to autoware-aligned topics
- [ ] Package structure consistency across all independent sensors
- [ ] Standard sensor_msgs message types used
- [ ] Launch system supports modular sensor selection
- [ ] Functionality preserved during autoware alignment
