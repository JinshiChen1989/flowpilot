# Task: Consumer-Safe Camera Migration

## Description
Carefully migrate camera system to autoware-aligned structure while ensuring zero regression in perception system functionality. This uses the compatibility bridges for safe transition.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migrate camera packages to autoware `/sensing/camera/` namespace structure
- [ ] Enable compatibility bridges during transition to preserve perception functionality
- [ ] Validate zero regression in perception detection and tracking systems
- [ ] Implement rollback capability if issues are detected
- [ ] Complete perception team validation and sign-off

## Technical Details
Safe migration process:
1. Deploy compatibility bridges first (preserve current functionality)
2. Update camera drivers to publish to both current and new topics
3. Gradually transition perception to consume from new topics
4. Remove old topics after validation
5. Remove compatibility bridges after full migration

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Feature flags to revert to original topics immediately
- Automated perception regression testing
- Coordination with perception team for validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006: Camera compatibility bridges implemented
- [ ] Coordination with perception team for migration testing
- [ ] Access to camera hardware for integration testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 32
- Parallel: false (requires careful sequential validation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Camera system migrated to autoware-aligned structure
- [ ] Perception system validated with zero functionality regression
- [ ] Migration can be rolled back safely if needed
- [ ] Perception team sign-off on successful migration
- [ ] End-to-end testing with detection and tracking systems completed
