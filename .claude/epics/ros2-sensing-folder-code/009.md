# Task: Hardware Integration Validation

## Description
Comprehensive validation of the complete refactored sensing system with real RK3588 hardware to ensure all proven patterns work correctly in integrated environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validate I2C threading pattern with real sensors on RK3588 I2C1 bus
- [ ] Test UART4 @ 115200 bps microROS communication with TriCore hardware
- [ ] Verify camera system integration with perception (zero regression)
- [ ] Validate autoware topic publishing and message formats
- [ ] Complete system stress testing under normal operating conditions

## Technical Details
Hardware validation checklist:
- **I2C Sensors**: ICM-42688 IMU, AK09918 compass, VEML7700 light, SHT40 humidity
- **UART Communication**: TriCore microROS @ 115200 bps on UART4
- **Camera System**: All camera feeds with perception integration
- **Independent Sensors**: GPS, RTK, CAN communication
- **Topic Validation**: All `/sensing/` topics publishing with correct message types

**Test Scenarios**:
- Individual sensor operation validation
- Multi-sensor concurrent operation
- System startup/shutdown stress testing
- Hardware disconnect/reconnect recovery
- Perception system integration validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 008: Unified launch system completed
- [ ] Access to complete RK3588 hardware setup with all sensors
- [ ] Coordination with perception team for final integration testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false (comprehensive validation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All sensors validated with real RK3588 hardware
- [ ] System performance meets or exceeds original capabilities  
- [ ] Autoware topic compatibility verified with ecosystem tools
- [ ] Hardware stress testing completed successfully
- [ ] System ready for production deployment with full hardware integration
