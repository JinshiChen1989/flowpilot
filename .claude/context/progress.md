# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Branch:** `gui_refactor`  
**Last Commit:** `a819601b7` - I2C_Manager  
**Working Tree:** Modified (CLAUDE.md has local changes)  

## Recent Accomplishments

### ROS2 Sensing Architecture Revision (Current)
- **PRD Created**: `ros2-sensing-folder-code` - Complete product requirements document for realistic sensing system refactoring
- **Epic Decomposition**: 9 realistic tasks based on proven hardware patterns from submodules analysis
- **Architecture Decision**: Adopted simple threading.Lock() patterns instead of complex I2C coordination
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identified working microROS UART4 @ 115200 bps implementation for reuse
- **Autoware Alignment**: Defined `/sensing/` namespace and standard sensor_msgs compatibility approach

### Latest Development Sprint (Last 10 commits)
- **I2C_Manager** - I2C communication management implementation
- **ccpm** - Configuration and control power management 
- **camera_ROI_HDR_AE_1** - Camera region of interest and HDR auto-exposure features
- **refactor_pyqt5_sensing** - PyQt5 sensing components refactoring
- **add sensors** - New sensor integration
- **pyqty5_refactor_i2c_ros2** - PyQt5 I2C and ROS2 integration refactoring
- **refactor** - General codebase refactoring
- **refactor_perception_helpers** - Perception helper functions refactoring
- **cam_calib_obd2_microros** - Camera calibration with OBD2 and micro-ROS
- **cam_calib_tricore_microros_OBD2** - Tricore camera calibration with micro-ROS and OBD2

## Current Focus Areas

### GUI Refactoring Initiative
Currently on `gui_refactor` branch, indicating active work on user interface improvements and modernization.

### Core System Integration
- I2C communication management for hardware interfaces
- Camera calibration and computer vision pipeline
- ROS2 integration for robotic perception
- PyQt5 GUI framework implementation
- Sensor data fusion and processing

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **ROS2 Sensing Implementation** - Execute the 9 realistic tasks from ros2-sensing-folder-code epic
2. **I2C Threading Pattern** - Implement Adafruit/DFRobot simple threading.Lock() approach
3. **MicroROS Integration** - Leverage existing UART4 @ 115200 bps implementation
4. **Complete GUI Refactor** - Finish current branch work
5. **Camera Compatibility Bridge** - Implement safe perception migration path

## Outstanding Work
