# PRD: Codebase Comprehensive Consistency Check

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines requirements for a comprehensive consistency validation system for the Nagasware autonomous vehicle platform. Given the safety-critical nature of autonomous driving software, maintaining consistent code quality, naming conventions, architectural patterns, and documentation across the entire codebase is essential for system reliability, maintainability, and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement

Nagasware is a complex autonomous vehicle platform with:
- **294+ directories** across perception, planning, control, and safety systems
- **Mixed technology stack** (Python 3.10+, C++, ROS2, PyQt5)
- **Multi-hardware support** (Hailo, Rockchip NPU, GPU acceleration)
- **Safety-critical requirements** (ISO 26262 automotive standards)
- **Real-time constraints** (< 100ms perception-to-control latency)

Inconsistencies in this environment can lead to:
- **Safety hazards** from integration failures
- **Performance degradation** affecting real-time requirements
- **Maintenance overhead** slowing development velocity
- **Regulatory compliance issues** preventing certification
- **Hardware compatibility problems** across different platforms

## User Stories

### As a Safety Engineer
- I want consistent error handling patterns across all safety-critical components so that failure modes are predictable and testable
- I want standardized logging formats so that safety incidents can be properly investigated
- I want consistent input validation so that all system boundaries are protected

### As a Perception Developer  
- I want consistent ROS2 package structure across all perception modules so that I can quickly understand and modify any component
- I want standardized message definitions so that camera, tracking, and fusion components integrate seamlessly
- I want consistent naming patterns for detection/tracking packages so that the system architecture is clear

### As a Platform Engineer
- I want consistent configuration management across all modules so that system deployment is reliable
- I want standardized hardware abstraction patterns so that new hardware can be integrated efficiently  
- I want consistent build and test patterns so that CI/CD pipeline works reliably

### As a Control Systems Engineer
- I want consistent timing patterns so that control loops meet real-time requirements
- I want standardized vehicle interface patterns so that different vehicle configurations work reliably

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Code Structure Consistency
- **ROS2 Package Standards**: Validate package.xml structure, naming conventions (*_interfaces, *_helpers, *_launch)
- **Directory Organization**: Ensure consistent structure across perception, planning, control modules  
- **Import Organization**: Standard import patterns (stdlib → third-party → ROS2 → local)
- **Configuration Hierarchy**: Validate config/ structure (global, environments, perception, safety, vehicle)

#### Language-Specific Consistency
- **Python Standards**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, Google-style docstrings, 88-char line limit
- **C++ Standards**: Google C++ style, RAII patterns, smart pointer usage
- **ROS2 Standards**: Node lifecycle, QoS settings, parameter validation

#### Safety & Reliability Patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent exception handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: Standardized validation at all system boundaries  
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup patterns (connections, file handles, memory)
- **Logging Standards**: Structured logging with consistent levels and formats

#### Performance Consistency  
- **Real-time Patterns**: Consistent approaches to meeting < 100ms latency requirements
- **Memory Management**: Standardized allocation patterns for embedded systems
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Consistent interfaces across Hailo, Rockchip, GPU platforms

#### Documentation Consistency
- **API Documentation**: Consistent docstring patterns and parameter documentation
- **Package README**: Standard structure and required sections
- **Configuration Documentation**: Consistent parameter descriptions and examples
- **Architecture Documentation**: Standard diagramming and description patterns

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **Analysis Speed**: Complete codebase scan in < 5 minutes
- **Incremental Checks**: Support for analyzing only changed files
- **CI/CD Integration**: Must not increase build time by > 30 seconds

#### Accuracy  
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% for critical consistency violations
- **Coverage**: Analyze 100% of Python/C++ code, ROS2 packages, and configuration files
- **Context Awareness**: Understand Nagasware-specific patterns and conventions

#### Maintainability
- **Rule Configuration**: Easy addition/modification of consistency rules
- **Reporting**: Clear, actionable reports with file locations and fix suggestions
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing development tools

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (MVP)
- **Automated Detection**: Identify 95% of naming convention violations across ROS2 packages
- **Safety Validation**: Flag all missing error handling in safety-critical paths
- **Style Consistency**: Achieve 100% compliance with Python/C++ style guidelines
- **Documentation Coverage**: Ensure all public APIs have proper documentation

### Long-term Success  
- **Zero Critical Violations**: No safety-critical consistency issues in production code
- **Developer Adoption**: 100% of developers using consistency checks in their workflow
- **Certification Support**: Consistency checks support ISO 26262 compliance documentation
- **Performance Validation**: No consistency violations affecting real-time requirements

### Quality Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: > 99% successful builds after consistency validation
- **Integration Issues**: < 1 integration issue per month due to consistency problems  
- **Code Review Efficiency**: 50% reduction in consistency-related review comments
- **Onboarding Time**: 40% reduction in time for new developers to understand codebase
